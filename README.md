# Car-Crashes-Severity-Prediction
# Car Crashes' Severity Prediction  ## Get Started:  You are given information about the environment of the car crash and you're required to predict the severity of the crash out of 4 level. The predictive system is already built but it needs some data of good quality. You need to prepare the dataset and train the prediction systems.  This predictive system will be helpful to anticipate the resources to engage by San Francisco Municipality depending on its severity.  ### Link  The link to this challenge can be found here:  [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/car-crashes-severity-prediction)
